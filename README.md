# Automation Task
This is where I Show My Knowledge and Skills in Test Automation!

### The main Frameworks included in the project:
* SHAFT: Unified Test Automation Engine

### Project Design:
* Page Object Model (POM) design pattern
* Data Driven framework
* Fluent design approach (method chaining)
* Implementing the ***Test Automation Pyramid*** by have 2 different test automation levels which are SERVICE and GUI layers
* Attaching a screenshot to the ***Allure Report***  report (in case of gui)  
* Attaching the response body to the ***Allure Report***  report (in case of api)

### Project Test Cases:
### Web GUI Test Automation:
### First Test
* Navigate to "https://www.google.com/ncr" 
* Search for "selenium webdriver" 
* Check that the third result text contains "What is Selenium WebDriver?" 
### second Test
* Navigate to "https://the-internet.herokuapp.com/" 
* Click on "File Upload" 
* Upload any small image file 
* Check that the file has been uploaded successfully 
### Third Test
* Navigate to "https://the-internet.herokuapp.com/" 
* Click on "Dynamic Loading" 
* Click on "Example 2" 
* Click "Start" 
* Wait for loading to finish 
* Check that the text displayed is "Hello World!" 
### API Test Automation:
* Navigate to "https://alexwohlbruck.github.io/cat-facts/" 
* Use the relevant API endpoint to get one random cat fact 
* Check that the response "text" is not empty
### How to run the project main test cases locally:
* Simply import this project to your eclipse (or favorite JAVA IDE) if your using <b>IntelliJ</b> please Refer to section below (How can I use SHAFT?)
* Watch this simple 5-minute live-demo: 
  https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NxBpObvbBHdMjL4tl7PlpRNi7U9lMfW8/view
* You Can find the test cases in the *src/test/java* folder mainly.
* After executing, you can easily generate the ***Allure Report***  you can find the Extent Report ***generate_allure_report.Bat*** in the project root path for the latest execution

### What is SHAFT?
- A Unified Test Automation Engine.
- A source controlled Java Maven project that is easily and regularly extended and enhanced with new features.
- Provides an easily understandable and user-friendly syntax for writing simple, robust, reliable, maintainable, and scalable tests.

- Provides a ton of built-in features in the Test Execution and Test Adaptation layers of the Generic Test Automation Architecture, and allows you to focus on the Test Generation and Test Definition Layers.

### How can I use SHAFT?
- Simply copy-paste the related configuration from the sample using_SHAFT_Engine project as shown in this 10-minute <b>Getting Started</b> video ‚ñ∂Ô∏è:<br/>[![How to do cross-browser test automation in 10 minutes using SHAFT_Engine](https://img.youtube.com/vi/3TYGteD843M/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TYGteD843M)
- If you wish to use SHAFT with <b>IntelliJ</b> please apply these settings:<br/>Run/Debug Configurations > Edit Configurations... > Templates > TestNG > Configuration > Listeners > Add all SHAFT_Engine Listeners [AlterSuite, InvokedMethod, Suite]
